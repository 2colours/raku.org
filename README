This is the source code http://perl6.org/

It is rendered with mowyw[1] every 15 minutes, so updates to the repository
should also result in an update of perl6.org. If not, talk to moritz_ on
#perl6.

Notes:
  
  - If you intend to change the layout, consider what happens when:
    * user's viewport is small (e.g. 800x600)
    * user resizes window

  - Test layout changes on browsershots.org, with particular consideration
    to badly broken browsers - IE6 still needs to be considered (2009-07).
    IE5.5 and below can be ignored.
    
  - jquery.min.js is in repo, i find i end up using it most of the time anyway
    All basic functionality (links, menus, proper page rendering) must be
    availalbe without javascript though.
  
  - other javascript stuff could go in page.js (at your discretion).

  - We spell "PerlÂ 6" consitently with a non-breaking space. If you don't have
    already, go get an editor with decent Unicode support.

  - Speaking of which, all pages are served as UTF-8.
