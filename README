This is the source code http://perl6.org/

It is rendered with mowyw[1] every 15 minutes, so updates to the repository
should also result in an update of perl6.org. If not, talk to moritz on
#perl6.

Here are some guidelines that you should respect when changing this site:

 * Only link to up-to-date information; feel free to delete outdated
   information - it is often more confusing than helpful

 * Be nice

 * Don't hesitate to link to pages you wrote youself, if they are helpful to
   a broader Perl 6 audience

 * If you have a Perl 6 blog, get it included in the planetsix.perl.org feed
   instead. Talk to [Coke] on #perl6

 * If you intend to change the layout, consider what happens when:
    - user's viewport is small (e.g. 800x600)
    - user resizes window

 * Test layout changes on browsershots.org, with particular consideration
   to badly broken browsers - IE6 still needs to be considered (2009-07).
   IE5.5 and below can be ignored.

 * We spell "PerlÂ 6" consistently with a non-breaking space. If you don't have
   already, go get an editor with decent Unicode support.

 * Speaking of which, all pages are served as UTF-8.
