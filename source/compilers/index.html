    <h2>Perl 6 Compilers</h2>

    <p>Perl 6 is a language specification, and just like C or C++ there
    are multiple compilers for the language.</p>

        <p><dt><a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a></dt>
        <dd>Rakudo is copyrighted by the Perl
        Foundation, was born and raised in the <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">
        Parrot virtual machine</a>, and now also runs on the Java Virtual Machine and
        <a href="http://moarvm.org/">MoarVM</a>.
        It is actively developed on the
        <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">Rakudo GitHub</a> site. <a
        href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">Download or compile
        Rakudo</a>.

        <p><dt><a href="http://github.com/sorear/niecza">Niecza</a></dt>
        <dd>Niecza is a compiler
        targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET and Mono).  Its goal
        is to explore the static aspects of Perl 6 and the possibilities
        for compile-time optimization.
        </dd></p>

        <p><dt><a href="/compilers/std-viv">STD</a></dt>
        <dd>STD is Larry Wall's reference implementation of the Perl 6 grammar,
        parser generator, and some of the semantic verifier. STD is an
        abbreviation of "Standard", as in "Perl6.0.0-STD". It is written in
        Perl 6, transliterated into Perl 5 by viv.
        It is also used by
        various phases of several other compilers (mildew, perlito, elf).
        </dd></p>

        <p><dt><a href="/compilers/std-viv">viv</a></dt>
        <dd>viv ("vi" to "v", 6 to 5)
        is a compiler that uses STD as its front-end. STD itself uses viv to
        build. It is actively developed along with STD.
        </dd></p>

        <p><dt><a href="http://www.perlito.org/">Perlito</a></dt>
        <dd>Perlito, also known as MiniPerl6,
        is a subset of Perl 6, designed as a light bootstrapping language.
        You can <a href="http://perlcabal.org/~fglock/perlito6.html">try it online</a>. It is
        actively developed <a href="http://github.com/fglock/Perlito/">here</a>.
        </dd></p>

        <p><dt><a href="http://pugscode.org/">Pugs</a></dt>
        <dd>Pugs is written in Haskell.
        Maintenance releases for successive versions of ghc are
        <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Pugs">published</a> to Hackage.

<h3>Supplementals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/niner/Inline-Perl5">Inline::Perl5</a> executes
    Perl&nbsp;5 code in Perl&nbsp;6.  Supports Perl 5 modules including XS
    modules like <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI">DBI</a>.  Allows
    passing integers, strings, arrays and hashes. Also supports calling methods
    on Perl 5 objects from Perl 6 and calling methods on Perl 6 objects from Perl 5.

    <a
    href="http://use.perl.org/_JonathanWorthington/journal/39530.html">Blizkost</a>
    is a Perl 5 bridge for Parrot, making Perl 5 code available from
    Rakudo and other parrot-based compilers.
