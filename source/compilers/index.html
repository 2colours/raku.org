    <h2>Perl 6 Compilers</h2>

    <p>Perl 6 is a language specification, and just like C or C++ there
    are multiple compilers for the language.</p>

    <h3>Compilers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> is copyrighted by the Perl
        Foundation, was born and raised in the <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">
        Parrot virtual machine</a>, and is actively developed
        <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">here</a>. <a

        Rakudo</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="http://github.com/sorear/niecza">Niecza</a> is a compiler
        targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET and Mono).  Its goal
        is to explore the static aspects of Perl 6 and the possibilities
        for compile-time optimization.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="/compilers/std-viv">STD</a>
        is Larry Wall's reference implementation of the Perl 6 grammar,
        parser generator, and some of the semantic verifier. STD is an
        abbreviation of "Standard", as in "Perl6.0.0-STD". It is written in
        Perl 6, transliterated into Perl 5 by viv.
        It is also used by
        various phases of several other compilers (mildew, perlito, elf).
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="/compilers/std-viv">viv</a> ("vi" to "v", 6 to 5)
        is a compiler that uses STD as its front-end. STD itself uses viv to
        build. It is actively developed along with STD.
        </li>
        <li>
        <a href="http://www.perlito.org/">Perlito</a>, also known as MiniPerl6,
        is a subset of Perl 6, designed as a light bootstrapping language.
        You can <a href="http://www.perlito.org/js">try it online</a>. It is
        actively developed <a href="http://github.com/fglock/Perlito/">here</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="http://github.com/masak/yapsi">Yapsi</a> is Yet Another
        Perl Six Implementation, an implementation of a Perl 6
        compiler-and-runtime in Perl 6.  Yapsi issues monthly releases
        and is actively developed.
        </li>

        <li>
        <a
        href="http://github.com/diakopter/sprixel">Sprixel</a> was a
        Perl 6 compiler targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET
        and Mono).  It has a storied history (many total rewrites), but it
        intended to implement a small strongly/natively-typed
        functional-programming subset of Perl 6 ("perlesque"), but
        specifically the flavor of Perl 6 used by STD, to facilitate
        quick bootstrapping of the official STD grammar and Cursor parser
        engine to the CLR.  It is no longer actively developed.

        <li>
        <a href="http://pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> is written in Haskell.
        Maintenance releases for successive versions of ghc are published to
        <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Pugs">Hackage</a>.
        The most recent (6.2.13.20110519 as of this writing (2011-07-27)) was
        released 2011-05-19.
