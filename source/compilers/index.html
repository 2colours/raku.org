    <h2>Perl&nbsp;6 Compilers</h2>

    <p>Perl&nbsp;6 is a language specification, and just like C or C++ there
    are multiple compilers for the language.</p>

    <h3>Compilers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a> is copyrighted by the Perl
            Foundation, was born and raised in the <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">
            Parrot virtual machine</a>, and is actively developed
            <a href="http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo">here</a>. <a
            href="http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo">Download or compile
            Rakudo</a>, <a href="http://rakudo.org/status">status</a>.

        <li>
            <a href="http://github.com/perl6/std">STD</a>
            is Larry Wall's reference implementation of the Perl&nbsp;6 grammar,
            parser generator, and some of the semantic verifier. STD is an
            abbreviation of "Standard", as in "Perl6.0.0-STD". It is written in
            Perl&nbsp;6, transliterated into Perl&nbsp;5 by "gimme5", and
            supported by Cursor.pm and Moose and others. It is also used by
            various phases of several other compilers (mildew, perlito, elf).
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://github.com/perl6/std/raw/master/viv">viv</a> ("vi" to "v", 6 to 5)
            is a compiler that uses STD as its front-end. STD itself uses viv to
            build. It is actively developed along with STD. To install a recent
            distribution of STD/viv to your Perl 5 installation, go

        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://github.com/sorear/niecza">Niecza</a> is a compiler
            targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET and Mono).  Its goal
            is to explore the static aspects of Perl 6 and the possibilities
            for compile-time optimization, though this is not yet well realized.
            It is actively developed.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://www.perlito.org/">Perlito</a>, also known as MiniPerl6,
            is a subset of Perl&nbsp;6, designed as a light bootstrapping language.
            You can <a href="http://www.perlito.org/js">try it online</a>. It is
            actively developed <a href="http://github.com/fglock/Perlito/">here</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://github.com/masak/yapsi">Yapsi</a> is Yet Another
            Perl Six Implementation, an implementation of a Perl&nbsp;6
            compiler-and-runtime in Perl&nbsp;6.  Yapsi issues monthly releases
            and is actively developed.

        <li>
            <a
            href="http://github.com/diakopter/sprixel">Sprixel</a> is a
            Perl&nbsp;6 compiler targetting the Common Language Runtime (.NET
            and Mono).  It has a storied history (many total rewrites), but it
            currently intends to implement a small strongly/natively-typed
            functional-programming subset of Perl&nbsp;6 ("perlesque"), but
            specifically the flavor of Perl&nbsp;6 used by STD, to facilitate
            quick bootstrapping of the official STD grammar and Cursor parser
            engine to the CLR.  It is actively developed.

        <li>
            <a
            href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?mildew">Mildew</a>
            uses STD.pm as a parser and SMOP as runtime. It is actively developed.
            <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl6/index.cgi?smop">SMOP</a>
            is a runtime library to represent Perl&nbsp;6 objects. It focuses on
            meta object programming capabilities.

        <li>
            <a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/Elf">Elf</a> is a bootstrapped
            compiler with Perl&nbsp;5 and Lisp backends. Actively developed as
            of July 2010. Its source lives
            <a href="http://github.com/perl6/mu/tree/master/misc/elf/">here</a>
            and

        <li>
            <a href="http://pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> is written in Haskell.
            Maintenance releases for successive versions of ghc are published to

            The most recent (6.2.13.15 as of this writing (2010-09-27)) was
